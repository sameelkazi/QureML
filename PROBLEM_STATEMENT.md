# Problem Statement 3: Hybrid Quantum Machine Learning Platform for Early Disease Detection

## Background

Early and accurate detection of diseases significantly improves treatment outcomes and reduces healthcare costs. Classical machine learning models have achieved notable success in medical diagnosis; however, they often face limitations when dealing with high-dimensional, noisy, and complex biomedical data (e.g., genomics, medical imaging, and electronic health records). Quantum machine learning (QML) offers the potential to capture intricate patterns through quantum superposition and entanglement. Due to current hardware constraints, a hybrid quantum-classical approach provides a practical pathway to leverage quantum advantages while remaining executable on existing quantum simulators and near-term quantum devices.

## Description

This problem focuses on designing and developing a hybrid quantum machine learning platform for early disease detection. The platform will integrate classical pre-processing and feature engineering with quantum-enhanced learning models (such as quantum support vector machines, quantum neural networks, or variational quantum classifiers). It will be applied to biomedical datasets for the early identification of diseases (e.g., cancer, cardiovascular disorders, or neurological conditions). The system should support data ingestion, hybrid model training, prediction, explainability, and performance evaluation against purely classical baselines.
